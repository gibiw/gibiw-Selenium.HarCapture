## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CDP as primary, INetwork as fallback — CDP provides detailed timings and response bodies; INetwork works cross-browser but lacks timings
- System.Text.Json over Newtonsoft.Json — Modern, no extra dependency for .NET 6+, source-gen ready
- netstandard2.0 target — Maximum .NET Framework / .NET Core / .NET 5+ compatibility
- Strategy pattern for capture backends — Clean separation, testable, extensible for future strategies
- Sealed model classes — HAR model is data-only, no inheritance needed, better performance
